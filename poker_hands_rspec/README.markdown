[http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataPokerHands](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataPokerHands)

Some example code from a Coding Dojo in London is available at:  
[https://github.com/codingdojolondon/sessions/tree/master/poker_hands](https://github.com/codingdojolondon/sessions/tree/master/poker_hands)

2H 3D 5S 9C KD 2C 3H 4S 8C KH  
2H 3D 5S 9C KD 2D 3H 5C 9S KH
