Houston Open Development User Group Dojo 001
============================================

This is the code for the coding dojo done by the Houston Open Development User 
Group on 2011-05-03.

This dojo is based off the Kata located at: 
http://acm.uva.es/p/v103/10315.html and 
http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataPokerHands

Some example code from a Coding Dojo in London is available at:
https://github.com/codingdojolondon/sessions/tree/master/poker_hands

The goal is given an input of 10 cards (first 5 = Hand 1, second 5 = Hand 2) 
determine the the winning hand and output that to the screen.

See the example below

Given a sample input of:

2H 3D 5S 9C KD 2C 3H 4S 8C AH
2H 4S 4C 2D 4H 2S 8S AS QS 3S
2H 3D 5S 9C KD 2C 3H 4S 8C KH
2H 3D 5S 9C KD 2D 3H 5C 9S KH

Output should be:

White wins.
Black wins.
Black wins.
